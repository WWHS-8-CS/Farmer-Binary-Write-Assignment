4.      Ones the customer has made the choice and you read the items from your text file then calculate the amount don’t have them buy only one item, they live In the middle of nowhere USA so they don’t get to visit the store which is 300 miles away from them that often.  Tell them what they have bought and the amount, give them the opportunity to buy more or return items if they did not have enough money to pay for everything.
5.      Thank the customer and have the receipt produced in text format not on the console which them well and ask them to come again.
